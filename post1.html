						<h2>NDA 3.0</h2>
            <p>It has always been the battle of alliances rather than the brawl of individual parties.</p>
            <p>The roots of the BJP can be traced back to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist organisation founded in 1925. Emerging as the political arm of the RSS, the BJP espouses a platform of Hindutva (Hindu nationalism), emphasising cultural identity, national unity, and socioeconomic development. In contrast, the Indian National Congress, established in 1885, played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence and has historically positioned itself as a centrist party advocating for secularism, social justice, and inclusive governance.</p>
            <p>In recent time, considering the last two election poll results, it is very evident that the BJP led NDA has a greater impact on the citizens of India. The numbers clearly show that the majority of votes are into the account of BJP making it easier to form the government at central without any external alliance other than NDA. 2014 results were astonishing as BJP had a massive total of 282 seats while INC could only take over at 44 constituencies to suffer a loss and to get into the field of opposition. The good deeds and ideologies of BJP had got them a surprise increase of 166 seats on comparison to the previous election. On the other side, Congress dropped down from election by loosing at 162 constituencies. Similarly 2019 election was no surprise as BJP continued to rule India for the next political term with an increase of 21 seats whereas Congress could only gain another 5 seats which made a negligible difference to UPA. 2024 result is anticipated and is in the favour of BJP. Several Opinion Polls clearly state the easy win of BJP and confirms itâ€™s governance for the next 5 years without any resolving. This confidence among the people of India is due to the mesmerizing principles for the betterment of social well-being of every individuals. A series of obliging reforms initiated by the BJP government has got a change in the way of thinking of indivisuals to get rid of the monotonous rule of Congress which were ruling for ages together.</p>
